                    Thank you for visiting my website.<br /><br />
                    
                    I am a second year Software Engineering student at McGill University, in the process of obtaining my B.SE. Outside my studies, I strive to develop new skills and actively seek to apply myself in domains that enable me to weave my interests together. I am currently seeking out opportunities to do so in a workplace environment where I could accrue valuable experience learning to apply the skills and knowledge I have developed in a practical environment. I believe my experience in both sports as well as other coding-related extracurriculars have positioned me excellently to contribute as an effective member of your team.

                <h3>Formula Electric <i class="fas fa-car"></i></h3>
                <p>As a member of the controls team on formula electric I am frequently challenged with the task of learning new things and applying them in code. Prior to joining this team I was unfamiliar with the process underlying the operation of a car let alone the code behind it. However, I took it upon myself to understand the fundamentals through online courses as well as discussions with team members. I am now very comfortable with said fundamentals and am excelling in my role of developing a regenerative braking system and integrating a PID controller for traction control.</p>

                <h3>Hackathons <i class="fas fa-desktop"></i></h3>
                <p>Starting in 2017 I began competing in Hackathons. From my experience participating in events such as: Angle Hacks, Boston hacks and Code Jam, I have learnt how to complete in high-stakes, time-sensitive tasks under strict deadlines.  Attending these hackathons is not only beneficial for the practical coding experience, but the social environment fostered by these events enabled me to develop relationships with a variety of accomplished students and to discover new technologies through the various conversations I had with them.</p>

                <h3>Hockey <i class="fas fa-hockey-puck"></i></h3>
                <p>Throughout my childhood, hockey was always a prominent aspect of my life.  From a young age I learnt what teamwork was.  Being involved with a team from the time I was 7 and into my early twenties allowed me to express my social skills at a young age, and has allowed me to improve these skills throughout the years. Teamwork has taught me leadership skills, communication skills and organizational skills, which come in handy in every task I pursue.</p>
